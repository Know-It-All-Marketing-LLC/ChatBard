# ChatBARD : An Intelligent Customer Service Center App

ChatBard  is an intelligent customer service center app powered by **Generative AI** and large language models (**LLM**) using **PaLM2 APIs**. ü§ñüí¨   
This demo of Flutter app is designed to inspire you and showcase how ChatBard can revolutionize customer support. It provides a chat interface where users can interact with a chatbot to ask questions and get answers. The app utilizes generative AI and large language models (LLMs), specifically PaLM2 APIs, to understand and respond intelligently to user messages. The demo app analyzes the context and examples provided to respond accurately, making it an invaluable tool for any customer service center.   
ChatBard can be easily customized to align with the nature of your business. By modifying the context and examples, you can tailor the chatbot's responses to your specific business requirements and customer interactions.  
Screenshots of the app showcase its functionality, including capturing conversations with clients and providing summarized records stored in Firebase. It offers both English and Arabic language support. Note that this is a developed feature in this app by creating a custom REST API for translation. PaLM2 and Bard are still under development and do not yet support the Arabic language.

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, make sure you have the following:

- Flutter SDK installed on your machine.
- A valid Firebase project with Firestore enabled.
- API credentials for the PaLM APIs of chat and text summarization used in the code.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the app:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or editor.
3. Replace the placeholder API credentials in the code with your actual credentials.
4. Update the Firebase configuration in the code to match your project.
5. Run `flutter pub get` in the project directory to install dependencies.
6. Connect a device or start an emulator. Skip this step if you prefer to use a web browser for displaying the app.
7. Run the app using `flutter run lib/main.dart`.

## Customize The App

To customize the app according to the nature of your business, you can modify the following variables in the `examples.dart` file:

1. `context`: This variable represents the context and scope of your business. Update it with a brief description that reflects the purpose and domain of your customer service center.

2. `examples`: This variable contains example conversations that include important information relevant to your business. These examples help learn the chatbot model to understand and respond accurately to user queries. 

By updating the `context` and `examples` variables with relevant information, you can tailor the chatbot's responses to align with your business's specific requirements and customer interactions.

Feel free to modify other parts of the code or user interface to meet your needs.
